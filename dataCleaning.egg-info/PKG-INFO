# DataProcessingMaster
Template for data processing, so we can use the same process on multiple data sets

# Using this Repo
In order to set up this repo on your local directory create a new branch to work on and clone this into the directory you are working in.

# Expected file structure
This program relies on local filepaths:
the expectation is you will install the repo into the same directory as you have the data in text format as such:
-ProjectFolder
  -Data
  -DataProcessingMaster
  
# Using the data processing script
working on adding setup.py so you can just run pip install -e . to handle all dependancies
